One day I became lazy of checking changes done and builds of nightlies of my lovely ROM - CyanogenMod
Thus I decided to write my own app that will do the dirty work for me:

This application for first release will do the following:

1. Gather information about:
 a. Changes done to the trunks of CyanogenMod project 
 b. Watch results of BuildBot and gather the all latest builds
2. Have a Service that will run and notify user about changes has been done number of them and new builds
3. Highlight different the builds and changes with colors to show their "status" and type
4. Take you to the commits details (over website)
5. Ideally download zip files into user preferred folder:
 - This choice is done, because CyanogenMod comes with Rom Manager pre-installed which can flush the ROM for you

Wish to have

*. Wish to have (need to check license and terms of Rom Manager) ability to flush ROM right from my app using Rom Managers scripts (This will require root permissions - 100%)
*. Take git diff from commits directly and display them nicely in the appl 


P.S. This is my first serious app and I will try to do my best on creating it.
